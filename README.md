# BrowserBot

A sample [Prague](http://github.com/billba/prague) browser-based bot. A good place to start in making your own.

# How to use

1. clone
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run build` (or `npm run watch` to build on changes)
4. `npm run start`
5. aim your browser at `http://localhost:8000`
6. say `Hi` to the bot (also try `I am <your name>`, `Wagon Wheel`, `Pubs in London`, and `show comment`)

# Where to go from here

1. update `src/bot.ts` to change/improve the bot
2. update to the latest [WebChat](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/) (or link to the CDN)
3. integrate your bot code with an existing web app
